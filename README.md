### UX
User can see which of 2 cities has better weather. User inputs city#1 in the left-hand input box and submits to get basic current weather information about that city. User inputs city#2 in the right-hand input box to get basic current weather information about that city. The user then selects the Who Wins? button to run a calculation to determine which city has the better weather and the prevailing city is displayed. If the result is a tie, the user is given a feedback message saying it's a tie.
